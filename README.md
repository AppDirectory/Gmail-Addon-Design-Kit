# Gmail Addon Design Kit

Google recently released official [Gmail Add-ons](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/category/works-with-gmail) on G Suite Marketplace. 

I've been working on a Gmail add-on for [Invoice.to](https://invoice.to) and drafted this Sketch library to make things easier for other designers designing Gmail Add-ons.

## Install

1. Download [Gmail Add-on Design Kit](https://github.com/ukaner/Gmail-Addon-Design-Kit/)
2. Open [Sketch app](https://www.sketchapp.com/)
3. Add Library by selecting "Gmail Addon Design.sketch" using File -> Add Library menu

## Use

You can use the library as you'd use any symbol, i.e via Insert -> Gmail Addon Design or [Sketch Runner](http://sketchrunner.com/)
